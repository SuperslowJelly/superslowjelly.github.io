The results, measured using a human trial with 23 participants, suggested that an overwhelming majority of players preferred the procedurally generated dungeons over their human-designed equivalents, with demonstrably increased player engagement, and improved gameplay experience.",

Labyrinth is a 2D pixel art top-down dungeon crawler for PS4 using a fully-proprietary data-driven 2D engine and renderer that has been built from scratch. This project includes more complex algorithms such as bi-directional A* pathfinding, enemy AI behaviour trees, entity component systems, real-time collisions, and other low-level engine features. The player can choose between a melee class and a ranged class which come with their own unique attacks and abilities. They can also customise their character's appearance by choosing one of 9 skins. The game itself follows the player through 4 uniquely designed levels depicting the floors of a castle, battling goblins along the way, ending in a labyrinth and a Minotaur boss. I will be using the game for master's dissertation, in which I will create a consolidated player skill quantification-influenced procedural world generation system.",
